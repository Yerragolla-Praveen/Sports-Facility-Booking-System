## Sports-Facility-Booking-System
### The Sports Facility Booking System is a user-friendly web application developed with Django to simplify booking sports facilities.
### Users can search for facilities by name or pincode and view detailed information, including descriptions and images. 
### The system dynamically displays available and booked slots, highlighted with different colors to prevent double booking.
#### Bootstrap ensures a responsive design, making the interface easy to navigate on any device. Booking forms are validated to avoid time conflicts, and users can see real-time updates on facility availability.
